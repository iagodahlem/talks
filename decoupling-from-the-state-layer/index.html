        <p>My name is Iago.</p>

          Hello everyone! My name is Iago, and today I'm here to talk about decoupling the state layer with custom hooks.

        <h3>What are <em>hooks</em>?</h3>
        <p>
          A feature provided by libraries for <strong>isolating</strong>, <strong>reusing</strong> and <strong>composing</strong> stateful logic.
        </p>

        <aside class="notes">
          So first, before we start, let's cover some ground basics, what are hooks?
          In the context of this talk, we will be referring to hooks as a feature in which a UI library allows you to have a
          better way to isolate, reuse and compose stateful logic.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>A concept independently of library...</p>

        <aside class="notes">
          So we can think in it as a concept, independently of library.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>...that allows us to handle stateful logic, detached from the view.</p>

        <aside class="notes">
          Where we can handle stateful or async logic detached from our components.
          Being easier to compose and reuse logic as well as to decouple our view from the state, independently of
          state management libraries if there's any being used, and so on.

      <section>
        <h4>Libraries</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>React: <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">Hooks</a></li>
          <li>Vue: <a href="https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html">Composition API</a></li>
        </ul>

        <aside class="notes">
          I'm not going to give a whole introduction about hooks, types of hooks or how to use them with React, Vue or whatever.
          Just know that React has a very good introduction to hooks, and Vue has a very similar feature called Composition API
          with a very good introduction as well.
          And be aware, that, independently of library you are using, be it Angular or whatever, it will have some feature that
          matches with hooks, so the techniques here apply.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>What about <em>custom hooks</em>?</h4>
        <p>
          A new hook, being composed by thirdy party hooks or other custom hooks.
        </p>

        <aside class="notes">
          Cool, now that we know what are hooks, what are custom hooks?

        <pre><code data-trim data-noescape data-line-numbers="1,4,8,9"><script type="text/template">
import React, { useState } from 'react'

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}

        <aside class="notes">
          Let's see this example, here we are using `useState` for having a local state within a component.

        <pre><code data-trim data-noescape data-line-numbers="1,4,7,8"><script type="text/template">
import { useState } from 'react'

const useCounter = (initialState) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialState)

  return {
    count,
    increment: () => setCount(count + 1),
  }
}
        </script></code></pre>

        <aside class="notes">
          If we create a new function, reusing hooks from React and export that to our component.

        <pre><code data-trim data-noescape data-line-numbers="2,5,9-10"><script type="text/template">

import useCounter from '...'

const Counter = () => {

          That's a custom hook.

        <h3>Why should I care? ü§î</h3>

        <aside class="notes">
          Nice, now that we have some stuff covered. Why should you care about using custom hooks to decouple the state layer?
          What does it even mean to have my state layer coupled or not?
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>Coupling...</p>

        <aside class="notes">
          First, to answer that, let's talk about what is coupling...
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>...is the degree of interdependence between software modules.</p>

        <aside class="notes">
          In software development and computer programming, coupling is the degree of interdependence between software modules.
          It was created as a part of software quality metrics to reduce maintenance and modification costs.
          It aims to improve readability and maintanability.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <div class="flex justify-space-beween">
          <div>
            <h4>Tight ‚ùå</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Dependent of each other</li>
              <li>No clearer data flow</li>
              <li>Harder to read, refactor and test</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Loose ‚úÖ</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Can be used separately</li>
              <li>Clearer separation of responsibilities</li>
              <li>Much easier to understand</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <aside class="notes">
          So we can say that if two modules are tight coupled to each other, they are highly dependent of each other, being very hard to reuse,
          and there's not a clear path from where the data flows trough the code.
          Yet if they are loosed coupled to each other, there's a clearer separation from where the data flows, and it's much
          easier to understand and refactor them.

      <section>
        <p>Coupling in UI libraries...</p>

        <aside class="notes">
          So talking about coupling in front-end development with modern UI libraries. We can think in it as having two main acting parts.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <div class="flex justify-space-beween">
          <div>
            <h4>View</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Handles presentation</li>
              <li>Semantics (HTML)</li>
              <li>Styling (CSS)</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>State</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Handles behavior</li>
              <li>Stateful logic</li>
              <li>Async calls</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <aside class="notes">
          The "View", or components, where we handle presentation like semantics and styling, and then there's also the "State"
          where we handle stateful logic, async calls, etc...
          And even tho they seem to be separate things, I'm pretty sure you have already seen components handling stateful logic
          or even worse things than that.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Decoupled View and State</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Better composability and reusability</li>
          <li>Clearer separation of concerns</li>
          <li>Good testability</li>
        </ul>

        <aside class="notes">
          So that's exactly what we want to avoid in our apps, to have a view decoupled from the state giving us a better
          composability, clearer separation of concerns into domain-oriented units, you can have custom hooks to represent
          portions of your domain having having single responsibility and good testability so we a have an standardized way to
          make testing easyli enough.
